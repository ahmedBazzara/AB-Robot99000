Welcome to AB-Robot-99k

the app is easy to deal with so if you're hoping to find instructions here, well you won't!!

it can be better by adding CSS rules in the page to make it look fancier,
but i'm still a begginer with it so i decided i won't use it at all here.

A grid with the pointer can also be added for easier tracking of the robot,
because if you want to keep up with the changes in the matrix that is printed on the console,
it won't make much sense since it's (-270 degress), in other words the Y-axis is upside down.


i wanted it to be simple and on the point, since it's an assignment to "show off my JS skills".
i kept different functionalities in different services to easy maintain the code and keep my main.js clean.
